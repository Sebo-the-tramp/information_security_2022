# Project for Information Security 2022

The following is the repository for the project of InSe 2022.

The repository is so divided: branch main, the unsecure and vulnerable app, the branch secure is the secured application. 

Everything else that can be needed is to be found in the wiki page, ['here']("https://github.com/Sebo-the-tramp/information_security_2022/wiki")

The folder ./cracking_server_group_Simon_GSchnell contains the results of my attacks. Both videos and scripts that are used.

In the wiki I will aslo add all the rest of the informations about the process.
